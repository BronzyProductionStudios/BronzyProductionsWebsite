      <br> In early <em>February</em> of this year, <strong>history</strong> was changed. I know it sounds cliche
   but it has truth to it. See the future of <b>space travel</b> is <strong>reusability</strong> everyone
    knows that. <em>SpaceX</em> was able to significantly cut <em>ULA's</em> (United Launch Alliance
    (<em>Boeing and Lockheed joint venture<em>)) cost simply by <b>reusing their boosters</b>
     instead of <i>dumping</i> them in the <b>Pacific or Atlantic</b> (Often the Atlantic) and
      expecting a heavy <b>payroll</b>.</br>

      <br> But even though the <em>reusable</em> and reliable <b>Falcon 9</b> (<em>Three</em> of which are used
 to make the <b>first stage</b> of the <b>Falcon Heavy</b>) booster had been flown over <em>40
  times</em> as of <b>February</b> no one believed a <em>reusable rocket</em> could get much past <b>Low
   Earth Orbit</b>. But in <em>February</em> the <b>Falcon Heavy</b> did just that and is bound for
    a <em>flyby of Mars</em>.</br>

      <h1 class="w3-text-blue">It's Awe Inspiring</h1>
    <br> I was given the privilege of watching the <em>Falcon Heavy</em> in person and for someone
 who has only seen a couple of rocket launches in his life (most of which were
  small <em>sounding rockets</em>), this was a great privilege. People knew this would be
   a launch like <b>no other</b>. There were people crammed on the side of the road and
    in the streets and on the beach. </br>

      <h1 class="w3-text-blue">LIFT OFF!</h1>
      <br>And when it <em>lifted off</em> it had a level of <i>strength</i>
                          unseen since the <b>shuttle</b> (Retired <em>7 years</em> prior) and
                           even the mighty <b>Saturn V</b> (Last launched in <i>1973</i>) and a
                            <b>payload capacity</b> <em>more</em> than the shuttle and only a
                             <em>couple tons off</em> the <b>Saturn V's</b> record. </br>

                             <br> The <b>landing</b> of the <b>twin side boosters</b> was a great
                          <em>success</em> with the almost <b>simultaneous landing</b>. However,
                           the only real failure of the entire mission was the
                            <em>miscalculation of the landing</em> of the <b>center stage</b>
                            which missed its <b>landing barge</b> and <i>plummeted</i> into
                             the ocean. Yet for all intensive purposes, this
                             rocket was a <b>success</b>. </br> 

                             <br>But this is simply a <b>stepping stone</b>. There will
                               be more but in the meantime, this is a great step
                                forward. For <b>all humankind</b>. </br>

                                        first reusable hybrid rocket system.</br>

                                      <br>Right now it costs twenty-two thousand
                                       dollars to take one kilogram of payload into
                                        low earth orbit. After two launches we will
                                         be able to take one kilogram of payload
                                          into low earth orbit for as little as
                                          one thousand dollars.</br>
