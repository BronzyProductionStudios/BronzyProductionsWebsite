      <h4><b>"I Rant Therefore I Am"-Dennis Miller</b></h4>
        <h6><i>We rant....a lot!</i></h6>
        <p>Is there anything sweeter than hearing someone rant for fifteen minutes about a topic, yeah give us the word toothbrush and we could make two episodes out of it! We decided that our random, repetive, rabid, rampant, raging rants (thats a shot for every word starting with R) were a great way to share our two cents on a topic, I mean give us 100 episodes and we'll rant about a toothbrush.</p>
        <p>We want to share what we think and also what you think, during the recording and writing of episodes we will be active on social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, we hope to record a RandomRant whenever we get a chance however most will end up in written form. Besides all that we hope to see you reading, listening or watching one of our rants and subscribe with your e-mail to be notified of all our new RandomRants</p>
