      <h1 class="w3-text-blue">Fortnite: Battle Royale,</h1><span class="w3-opacity">Andrew Flynn, June 9th, 2018</span>
      <br>Fortnite Battle Royale, a bright, brash multiplayer shooter. It was released
   last year and is now one of the biggest online games out there. With more than
   40m players worldwide, the chances are either your children or their friends
    are already passionate fans.</br>

    <br>In short, it’s a mass online brawl where 100 players leap out of a bus on to
 a small island and then fight each other until only one is left. Hidden around
  the island are weapons and items, including shotguns, rifles and grenade launchers,
   and the player must arm himself or herself while exploring the landscape and building.
    It’s also possible to collect resources that allow you to build structures where
     you can hide or defend yourself.</br>

    <br>Fortnite was originally released in July 2017, but it actually started out as a four-player survival game set on a post-apocalyptic earth. Players had to build shelters against horrifying zombies.</br>

    <br>The new game arrived last September and the developer made three brilliant decisions. First, it was launched as a standalone title separate from the original Fortnite now known as Fortnite: Save the World, allowing it the gain a huge fan base; secondly, it was released as a completely free digital download, which made it easily accessible and it came out not just on PC, but on Xbox and PlayStation. The third one is that he created Fortnite. </br>

      <br>Fortnite is so popular with kids because it’s free, its fun and it has a very offbeat sense of humor. While PUBG has a serious, realistic visual style, Fortnite Battle Royale has very bright, almost cartoon-like graphics as well as loads of ridiculous items and costumes, such as space suits and dinosaur outfits. This all comes at a price, paying with in game currency known as V-Bucks which are obtained by playing through the game to reach a high tier (the form of ranking) to get a 100 V-Buck incentive or by purchasing Fortnites other game mode Save The World for $40 or higher if you want extra content, or as we know from games like Clash Of Clans and Star Wars Battlefront by paying real money to purchase in game money to purchase in game virtual items that give the player no advantage. </br>

      <br>You can also pull a variety of dance moves during the game, and one of these include the Floss, inspired by the viral video of the boy dancing with Katy Perry during her Saturday Live appearance. All of this means the game is really fun to watch as well as play, making it a huge success just like all the famous video games. Kids also love to watch You Tubers and Twitch streamers, which is also a big reason for its success. </br>
