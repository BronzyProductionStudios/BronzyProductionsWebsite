      <h1 class="w3-text-blue">Crushing It!: Gary Vaynerchuk, </h1><span class="w3-opacity">Stephen Flynn, June 9th, 2018</span>
      <br> The <b>four-time</b> best selling New York Times author is back. The author,
       of course, being the successful VaynerMedia CEO <b>Gary Vaynerchuk</b>, on <b>January
        30th</b> of this year Gary released his much awaited follow up to the 2009
         book <b>Crush It!</b>, a book about cashing in on your passion. Crush It! was
          met with great success not only giving Gary a bit more success in the
          path of becoming a great author but also providing many of the readers
          with the boost they needed to start cashing in on their passions and
          follow what they love to do.</br>

          <br> This caused many of whom to become fairly <b>wealthy</b> in the process.
           This new book Crushing It! is very like  Crush It! except for one big
            difference, this book is not about Gary's rise to fame or how he became
             the <b>entrepreneur</b> he is today but how the readers of Crush It! followed
              it and made a name for themselves, upon reading the book you may
              recognize a few big names that were either motivated to start because
               of Crush It! or played a factor in starting their <b>success</b>. </br>

      <h1 class="w3-text-blue">About Gary</h1>
    <br> Gary Vaynerchuk was born in <em>Babruysk</em> in Belarus on November 14th, 1975
    currently aged <em>42</em> years old. His family immigrated to America where he noticed
    his love for <bold>“flipping”</bold> items (buying items for a low price and then re-selling
     them for a higher price), selling baseball cards and traveling across town
     to go to the yard and garage sales and buying items for low prices.</br>

     <br>  He then saw an opportunity in his father's liquor store and turned it
      into <strong>Wine Library</strong>, taking over his father’s business turning it from a <b>$3
      million dollar</b> business to a <b>$60 million dollar</b> one. Now he runs <strong>VaynerMedia</strong>
       and a host of other businesses with the name Vayner attached to it, he was
        also an investor in many early startups like Snapchat also netting him a
         large return on investment. All of this work has earned him a large
          following on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram, it is nearly
          impossible to see one of his grasping motivational speeches bouncing
          the internet from time to time.</br>

      <h1 class="w3-text-blue">About CrushingIt!</h1>
      <br>Crushing It! personally is one of the <b>greatest</b> accomplishment in
      Vaynerchuk's career, he managed to bring together a community of people
      that were all <b>enlightened and inspired</b> by him (as ego loving as it sounds),
       but what is more amazing is that maybe all those people wouldn’t be there,
        many wouldn’t have a home, children, a relationship or financial stability
         if it weren’t for the Crush It! book. Gary likes to call this a <b>celebration</b>
         of all those who achieved what they wanted from the book and here is the
          celebration. </br>

          <br>At <b>263 pages</b> the book is fairly short but packed information,
          there's nothing other to say rather than to read the book, but I will
          draw a quick conclusion, though this book is great and provides a much
          bigger platform to share the stories touched and moved by the story of
          Crush It! and possibly convince the next <b>generation</b> of entrepreneurs
          to make the leap this book was not as good as the original Crush It!.
          However, I would put it down to your preferred style of learning and
          take in information, personally the Crush It! book had a lot more content
           and provided a stepping stone of <b>knowledge</b> to use for yourself, but
           in total both books are amazing.</br>

             <h1 class="w3-text-blue">Who Does Crushing It! Help, </h1>
             <br> This book is a great example of how anyone can turn their lives
              around from injured <b>NHL players to criminals</b> who want to start over.
               The book speaks in my mind to <b>everyone</b> differently, some could be
                inspired, motivated or realize that this isn’t the thing for them,
                but it is impossible to finish this book without feeling different
                 about <b>entrepreneurship</b> at the end. Summing things up this book
                  is basically open to any and every category out there, everyone
                   could at least use one bit of information from this book due
                   to how insightful it is.</br>

             <h1 class="w3-text-blue">Best Parts</h1>
           <br> Crushing It! doesn’t exactly come with any gripping story and is
            very <b>repetitive</b> in a good way, the book was made from e-mail conversation
             with entrepreneurs who read <b>Crush It!</b>, and it helped them achieve
              their goals, don’t get me wrong each story is unique in its own
              way but they all follow a slight pattern, it’d start with a tough
              situation e.g bankruptcy, then notice an <b>opportunity</b> to make money,
               start small, read Crush It!,  started crushing it, go big, then
               make it big.</br>

          <br> Yes, this would be how many other small startups would make it big
           but to pick the best part would be the <b>footnotes</b> and <b>characteristics</b>
           of a business Gary has added, remember how I said that each story was
            <b>unique</b> in its own way? Well with the added characteristics and footnotes
             Gary points out what that one entrepreneur excelled at, e.g, providing
              content, time management, speed etc, they all correlate together.</br>

           <br> <b>Crushed It!</b> is rumoured to be the next book currently in the
            writing process, not much is known about this book or its release or
             if it is even a book in production, many people who have read both
              Crush It! and Crushing It! are already lining up to have their story
               told in the <b>unconfirmed</b> next book, we hope for a blend of both
               books, this would provide a great stepping stone for people to
               grasp and a way of putting what they <b>learnt</b> into use by following
                others.</br>
