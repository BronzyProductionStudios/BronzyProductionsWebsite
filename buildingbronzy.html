      <p>Annnnd we probably won't finish this project on time...yes I am a fucking jinx. The site is finsihed however which I guess technically counts but we still have to run it fully as a demo which we failed to do last time..yeah skip forward a month or two and we have to re-design our site, however it's for the beter. I hope. On top of everything else todays work will consist of renaming all the files to mach how they are going to go into the server e.g making the bronzy2.1.html file an index.html file so the sere will recognize it as it's maine page. But on Wednesday we are finally going to put out our first Instagram post in a while. </p>
      <p>Also Oisin if you're reading past Stephen says answer you fucking phone or else we wont be able to launch! Yeah if this launch doesen't go to the date it was planed I blame Oisin for not charging his phone, I know he's gonna read this so Oisin you don't need to have your phone at 0% to charge it like what the actual fuck man. But as usual thanks for reading BuildingBronzy day 3 and we hope to see you on Wednesdy!</p>

      <p>We are finally gonna finish a project by its deadline yasssss! Spent a full 6 and half hours trying to figure out why the website wasn't working...I mean everything, other than check if my laptop was connected to the internet. So far very productive. On a completely un-related topic I found the song that I couldn't find the name to. </p>
      <p>But on a plus note, we now have fully functional RandomRants page that has capabilities of being a home for our YouTube, Podcast and written contetnt in RandomRants, we are running with a nice enough color scheme for it, it is color coded to match the platforms icons, purple for podcast and red for YouTube. I think it looks ok for a first attempt. Aswell as that the new review page is about to be finished as I'm writing so it will be ineresting to see how it turns out, it's been optimised for more ad space. Anyway that all hope to see you all on Wednesday!</p>

      <p>We have started! By the time this is launched there will already be nearly a weeks worth of BuildingBronzy content on the site. Our intention is to document our time on the website, everyhting we do day to day to make and bring the content that serves our users. Currently just finished the BuildingBronzy page and setup a Photoshop template for each day. Along with that I am currently starting the RandomRants page which may not be updated as regularly but it will serve as a major part of the platoform once the content is uploaded for it. </p>
      <p>We want to scale Bronzy largly and to do achieve that we need to put in a major amount of work and effort, we hope that BuildingBronzy will be a way of documenting our journey there.</p>
