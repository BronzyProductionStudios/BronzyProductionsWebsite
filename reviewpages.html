  <h2><i> The 2018 NBA Finals: Golden State vs Cleveland Cavaliers</i></h2>
  <h4>By <cite>Oisin Brick</cite></h4>
  <hr />

  <br> It is that time of year again where you start to ingnore everything
   else and listen to the sweet swishing of nets and deafening dunks of basketballs.
    And what better way to do that than to see the best players battle it out in the
     <b>NBA Finals.</b> But before I get into angthing, can we just appreciate the
      fact that the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers made it into
       the finals for the 4<sup>th</sup> consecutive year? What was that you said?
        You are a Cleveland and or Warriors fan and even you are sick of see them
         in the finals? Yep me too. Although, I am a Houston Rockets fan myself.
          Houston Rockets R.I.P (2018 Westen Conference Finals) ;(. </br>

<br><em>Okay.</em> Now that we got that out of the way, lets talk
   about the Warriors and Cavaliers rematch. Just by looking at the standings,
    we can see that Golden State have a minor advantage with winning 8 more games.
     But that is not all. I think that we can say if we are 100% honest with ourselves
      that Golden State have so much more star power. But that is not to say Lebron
       won't put up a fight. As we all witnessed in game 1 when he dropped 51 points!
        But as we also witnessed, Cleveland losing the game. But it is unfair to
         say that it was <i>The King's</i> fault.(cough Jr.Smith). Regardless, I
          think Cleveland still has a chance. Because they do have the greatest
           player of our generation in Lebron James and agruably greatest ever.</br>

<br>Now that a couple of games have passed, it has become apparent
   as to who is running away with this series. I will admit that I did not see
    Golden State taking a <i><b>3-0</b></i> lead against Lebron's Cavaliers but
     the results dictate otherwise. Curry and Durant made sure of that. I mean,
      Curry was doing work the first two games with him scoring a median of
       <strong>31 PPG</strong> and Kevin exploding with <b>43 points</b> and
        <b>13 rebounds</b> to give the Warriors a 3-0 lead despite Lebrons efforts.
         And I really do feel fo Lebron and Cleveland fans alike. I know everyone is
          still in hopeful spirits going into game 4. I hope they pull out at least
           one win. I don't think it would be deserving for Lebron considering his
            tremendous play thus far. though, that's just my opinion. But you cannot
             deny his stats. They speak for themselves. I mean, you have to look in
              awe when you realise that <i><b>The King</b></i> is averaging <b>38
                 PPG, 11 APG and 9 RPG!</b> If you are not at least impressed by
                  those stats i'm going to do it. I'm going to call you a <i>"Lebron
                     Hater".</i>And all why he is 33 years old! Now we're just
                      going to have to wait until game 4. Where either Lebron will
                       pull out his first victory of the series or the Warriors will
                        walk home with their 3<sup>rd</sup> NBA Championship in 4
                         years.</br>
